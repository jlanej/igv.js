fix: load per-variant tracks during XLSX/HTML export screenshots

Root cause
----------
The XLSX and HTML export loops only called igvBrowser.search(locus) to
navigate to each variant's position, then used a fixed 1500 ms setTimeout
before capturing a screenshot via toSVG().  This had two problems:

1. No per-variant track loading -- the export reused whatever alignment/VCF
   tracks were loaded from the last manual click.  Different variants can
   reference different BAM/CRAM/VCF files (different trios), so the tracks
   were often wrong or stale.

2. Race condition -- search() recreates viewport DOM elements and triggers
   async data loading.  The fixed timeout frequently expired before
   loadFeatures() finished, leaving featureCaches empty.  toSVG() reads
   directly from featureCache, so the resulting SVG contained only the
   track outlines with no reads.

Why previous attempts failed (PRs #35-42)
-----------------------------------------
All six prior PRs kept the same broken search()-only pattern in the export
loop and tried to fix the symptom with increasingly complex wait/poll/retry
mechanisms (checking featureCache, canvas pixels, isLoading(), packedGroups,
etc.).  These either broke screenshot capture entirely ("no images at all")
or introduced fragile dependencies on internal igv.js API surface that
changed between calls, and were all reverted.

Fix
---
Add loadVariantForScreenshot(variant) which mirrors the existing, working
showInIgv() function:

  1. igvBrowser.removeAllTracks()     -- clear stale tracks
  2. igvBrowser.search(locus)         -- navigate to variant position
  3. igvBrowser.loadTrackList(tracks)  -- load correct per-variant tracks

loadTrackList() internally awaits resize() -> updateViews() ->
loadFeatures() for every viewport, so by the time it returns all
featureCaches are populated and toSVG() will render alignment data.

A double-requestAnimationFrame yield follows to ensure the browser has
settled DOM layout (needed by getBoundingClientRect() in renderSVGContext).

No polling, no retries, no probing of internal igv.js state.
